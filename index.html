  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Steve Marvel Coen. I am a recent graduate of Oberlin College (2011).
    At Oberlin I studied Creative Writing and Religion, but after school ended I ended up
    becoming insterested in computer science and web design. I currently do freelance web
    design and am about to start an internship doing database design with Support Group Inc.
    </p>
  <h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
    <p>I am still pretty inexperienced in terms of my cs knowledge and would love to expand
    what I can do with web design. I have a pretty solid grasp of CSS, HTML, and some JS,
    and adding more knowledge of web applications would be really great.</p>
  <h2>What previous experience do you have with programming</h2>
    <p>After college I worked at Harvard Medical School doing administrative work. This
    included writing web content for a number of departments. Eventually this began to
    involved editing website layouts as well, and finally turned into designing sites
    from scratch.</p>
    <p>I was still quite inexperience though, so after working at HMS I took a course
    here at Harvard Extension School on Javascript (CSCI E-3). After that I did some
    freelance design at Tufts University.</p>
   <h2>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
    <p>I am working on a Mac.</p>
   <h2>Anything else we should know?</h2>
    <p>I don't think so. I'm really excited to be taking this course. I already feel like
    I'm learning a lot and having fun.</p>
